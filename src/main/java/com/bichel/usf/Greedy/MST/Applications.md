Applications of Minimum Spanning Trees:
- Network design: Spanning trees can be used in network design to find the minimum number of connections required to connect all nodes. Minimum spanning trees, in particular, can help minimize the cost of the connections by selecting the cheapest edges.
- Image processing: Spanning trees can be used in image processing to identify regions of similar intensity or color, which can be useful for segmentation and classification tasks.
- Biology: Spanning trees and minimum spanning trees can be used in biology to construct phylogenetic trees to represent evolutionary relationships among species or genes.
- Social network analysis: Spanning trees and minimum spanning trees can be used in social network analysis to identify important connections and relationships among individuals or groups.
