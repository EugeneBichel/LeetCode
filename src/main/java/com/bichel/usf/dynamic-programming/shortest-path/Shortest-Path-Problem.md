● We are given a directed graph G = (V, E) with edge weights c[e] and source s.
● We want to compute shortest-path distances from s to every node.
● Recall: Dijkstra’s algorithm may fail when G has negative edge weights.
● We’ll learn how to solve this problem using DP which works even if G has negative
edge weights.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm solve the Single-Source
Shortest Path Problem (SSSP).
