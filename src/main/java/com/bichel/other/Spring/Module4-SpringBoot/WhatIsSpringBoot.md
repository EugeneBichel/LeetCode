Spring Boot is a Java Framework that allows you to easily create stand-alone,
production-grade Spring based Java Applications. It is often used in Microservice
Architecture because of simplicity that it allows.

Applications created with Spring Boot can be executed with simple java –jar
command and also allows traditional war deployment. Spring Boot supports following
embedded containers:
     Tomcat
     Jetty
     Undertow
    
Spring Boot provides many modules under common umbrella:
     Spring Boot DevTools – live-reload to speed-up development
     Spring Boot Actuator – monitoring and management of application
     Spring Boot Starters – dependency set for technologies to minimize setup time
     Spring Boot Autoconfiguration – configuration templates for technologies to minimize setup time
    
On top of it, you can use all Spring Framework technologies, like:
     Spring Web – Spring MVC Framework
     Template Engines – server side rendering engines for web pages
     Spring Security – authentication and authorization framework
     Spring Data MongoDB – NoSQL database client

Maximizes productivity
     Simplifies deployment, by allowing to create executable jar, and also supports traditional deployment on top of application server
     Provides automatic configuration which reduces boilerplate configuration, and allows easy customization when defaults are not sufficient
     Allows for Dev/Prod Parity (https://12factor.net/)
     Provides set of managed dependencies
     Provides Maven Plugins
     Provides non-functional features common for projects - externalized configuration, security, metrics, health checks
     Integrates with Micro Service Architecture Tools for building Highly Available and Fault Tolerant Applications – Eureka, Ribbon, OpenFeign
     Integrates with systemd and init.d, which allows to easily run applications as Linux Services
     Uses IoC/DI from Spring Framework
