Classpath is a parameter in the Java Virtual Machine or the Java compiler that specifies the location of user-defined classes and packages. The parameter may be set either on the command-line, or through an environment variable.

The class path is the path that the Java runtime environment searches for classes and other resource files.

Spring abstracts out resources like file, classpath, URL etc. using a common interface called Resource. This article shows an example of classpath resource.
