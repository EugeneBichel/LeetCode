[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm):
    A greedy algorithsm is an algorithm paradigm that follows 
    the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal
    choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
    In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce
    an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may
    yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal
    solution in a reasonable time.

    Using a greedy algorithm does not guarantee an optimal solution,
    because picking locally optimal choices may result in a bad global
    solution, but it is often faster to calculate.
