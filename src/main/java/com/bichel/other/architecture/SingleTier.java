    /*
    A single-tier application is an application where
    the user interface, backend business logic &
    the database all reside in the same machine.

    One big downside of single-tier app is that the
    business has no control over the application.
    Once the software is shipped, no code or features
    changes can possibly be done until the customer manually
    updates it by connecting to the remote server or by
    downloading & installing a patch.
