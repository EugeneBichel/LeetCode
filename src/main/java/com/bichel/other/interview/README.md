### Tell me a little about the history of Java as a language?
Java was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystem (later acquired by Oracle) and first appeared in 1991. It is one of the most widely used general purpose concurrent, class-based and object-oriented programming languages.

### What is meant by the statement Java is platform independent?    
Java works on the principle of write once and run anywhere. Once a Java program is written, it gets compiled into what is known as the byte code, which can then be run on any Java Virtual Machine or JVM for short.    
Compilation to bytecode is the magic behind Java's interoperability. Different operating systems and hardware architectures have JVMs custom designed for themselves and all JVMs can run the same bytecode. Therefore, if you write a Java program on Linux, it will run seamlessly on a JVM designed for Windows operating system, making code agnostic to the underlying hardware and OS.

### What is meant by the Java platform?
Java is both a programming language as well as a software platform. The platform consists of:    
Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
Java Application Programming Interface (Java API)
