    A memory model is defined as the set of rules according to which the compiler,
    the processor or the runtime is permitted to reorder memory operations.
    Reordering operations allow compilers and the like to apply optimizations
    that can result in better performance. However, this freedom can wreak havoc
    in a multithreaded program when the memory model is not well-understood with
    unexpected program outcomes.
