Spring Boot allows you to externalize configuration for the application by using properties stored in properties files that can be in format:
     YAML
     Java Properties File
    
YAML is a superset of JSON and it is convenience for specifying hierarchical data. Spring Boot supports YAML properties with usage of SnakeYAML library, which is included by default by spring-boot-starter.
