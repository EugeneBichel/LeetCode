public class CapturingLambdas {
    /*
    A lambda expression is said to be capturing if it either accesses instance variables of it’s enclosing class or local variables (final or effectively final) from it’s enclosing scope.

    A lambda expression can capture the three types of variables given below:

    Static variables
    Instance variables
    Local variables

    If a lambda expression captures a local variable then the variable should be either final or effectively final.

    Effectively final is a new concept that was introduced in Java 8. A non-final, local variable whose value is never changed after initialization is known as effectively final.
