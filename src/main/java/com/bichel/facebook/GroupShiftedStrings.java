/*
We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.
For example, "abc" can be shifted to be "bcd".
We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.
For example, we can keep shifting "abc"
to form the sequence: "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz".
Given an array of strings, group all strings[i]
that belong to the same shifting sequence. You may return the answer in any order.
