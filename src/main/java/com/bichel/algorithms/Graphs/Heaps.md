## Binary heap
A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with the following properties:
- It is a complete tree (all levels are completely filled except possible the last level
 and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property makes them suitable
 to be stored in an array.
- A Binary Tree is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min Binary Heap, 
the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap.
