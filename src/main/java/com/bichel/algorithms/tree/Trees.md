## Trees

 - Binary tree is a tree where each node has up to 2 child nodes.
 - Binary search tree (ordered binary tree) is a tree where left child nodes 
 contain only values less than the parent node, 
 and where right child nodes contain only values more than the parent node.
 - The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node
 - The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf
 - The height of a tree is a height of the root
- A full binary tree is a binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two child nodes
- A complete binary tree is a binary tree, which is completely filled, with the possible exception
of the bottom level, which is filled from left to right

## Traverse
To traverse means to visit the vertices in some systematic order.

### Traversal methods for trees
- preorder: visit each node before its children
- inorder (for binary trees only): visit left subtree, node, right subtree
- postorder: visit each node after its children
