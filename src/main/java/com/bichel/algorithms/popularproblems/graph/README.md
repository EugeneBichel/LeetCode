# Dijkstra
 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-in-java-using-priorityqueue/ 

Here the only drawback with Dijkstra algorithms is that while finding the shortest path as listed as follows as we need to find the least cost path by going through the whole cost array. Not a big deal for small graphs and at the same time becomes an efficiency issue for large graphs because each time we need to run through an array while traversing. Now as we know queues can work for us so do we apply the concept of priority queues with this algorithm to erupt out some of the disadvantages and making complexity much better.
