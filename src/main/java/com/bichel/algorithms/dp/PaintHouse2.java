/*
There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted
with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house
with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses
such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented
by an n x k cost matrix costs.

For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0;
costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on...
Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.
