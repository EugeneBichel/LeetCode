/*
In graph theory, a tree is an undirected graph
in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path,
or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph.

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph
that is connected and has no cycles.
You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes
labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added.
The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n,
and was not an edge that already existed.
The graph is represented as an array edges of length n
where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge
between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is
a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers,
return the answer that occurs last in the input.
