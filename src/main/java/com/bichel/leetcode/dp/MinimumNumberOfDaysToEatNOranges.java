/*
There are n oranges in the kitchen and you decided to eat some of these oranges
every day as follows:

Eat one orange.
If the number of remaining oranges n is divisible by 2 then you can eat n / 2 oranges.
If the number of remaining oranges n is divisible by 3 then you can eat 2 * (n / 3) oranges.
You can only choose one of the actions per day.

Given the integer n, return the minimum number of days to eat n oranges.
