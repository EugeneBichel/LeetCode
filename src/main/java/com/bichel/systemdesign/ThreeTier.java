    /*
    Three-tier applications are pretty popular & largely used in the industry. Almost all of the simple websites like blogs, news websites etc. are part of this category.

    In a three-tier application, the user interface, application logic & the database all lie on different machines & thus have different tiers. They are physically separated.

    So, if we take the example of a simple blog, the user interface would be written using Html, JavaScript, CSS, the backend application logic would run on a server like Apache & the database would be MySQL. A three-tier architecture works best for simple use cases.
